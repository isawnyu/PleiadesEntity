BatchCreation.txt
=====================

Test batch creation of GeographicEntityLite objects.

A lot of this is cribbed from optilude's tutorial on plone.org.

Setup the test fixture

    >>> folder = self.folder

Create a batch of entities

    >>> from Products.GeographicEntityLite.Extensions.batching import loaden
    >>> loaden(folder, source)

Check count of created entities

    >>> entities=folder.listFolderContents(contentFilter='GeographicEntityLite')
    >>> len(entities)
    4
