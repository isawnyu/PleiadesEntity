<p class="callout">
Pleiades is an international research network and associated web portal
and content management system (CMS) devoted to the study of ancient
geography.
</p>
<h3>Governance and Participation</h3><p>
Organized by the 
    <a href="http://www.unc.edu/awmc">Ancient World Mapping Center</a> at the 
    <a href="http://www.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>,
    U.S.A., <b>Pleiades</b> brings together a global community of scholars,
    students and enthusiasts to expand and enhance continually the
    information originally brought together by the <a href="http://www.unc.edu/depts/cl_atlas">Classical Atlas Project</a>
    (1988-2000) to support the publication of the 
    <i><a href="http://www.unc.edu/awmc/batlas.html">Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World</a></i> 
    (R.J.A. Talbert, ed., Princeton, 2000).</p>
    <p>Our name, "Pleiades" (the daughters of Atlas in Greek Mythology) reflects both this heritage and the forward-looking
        goal of collaborative diversification.</p>
        
<h3>How Does That Work?</h3>
<p>Combining community approaches (like those used by 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>) with academic-style 
    editorial review, Pleiades enables anyone — from university professors to casual students of antiquity — 
    to suggest updates to geographic names, descriptive essays, bibliographic references and geographic coordinates.
    Once vetted for accuracy and pertinence, these suggestions become a permanent, author-attributed part of future
    publications and data services.</p><h3>Status</h3><p>The Pleiades web portal and content management system are currently under development. Please visit <a href="development/" target="_self">our Development Section</a> for more information.<br /></p>

<h3>Support and Software</h3>
<p>Initial startup funding for Pleiades is generously provided by the U.S. 
    <a href="http://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a>
    with a two-year grant (2006-2008) through its <i>Preservation and Access
    Research and Development</i> program.</p>
    <p>Hosting for Pleiades during this period is provided by the <a href="http://www.stoa.org/">Stoa Consortium</a> and the <a href="http://www.rch.uky.edu/">Collaboratory for Research in Computing for Humanities</a> at the University of Kentucky.</p>
    <p>The Pleiades web portal is being built atop the open-source 
        <a href="http://plone.org/">Plone Content Management System</a>, with the addition of a number of 
        plugin components (Plone "Products").
        All modifications and special-purpose plugins developed by the Pleiades 
        Community will be released to the public for free re-use under
        compatible, open-source licensing.
