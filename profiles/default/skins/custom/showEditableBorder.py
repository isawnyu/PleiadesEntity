#    TODO: This is an ugly hack.  So it might as well
#    be explained.  Traditionally in CMF actions
#    are lumped in by categories.  workflow/object/folder and more.
#    well.  to show a green border means that the user can
#    interact with the content.  We have to sort of 'action scrap'
#    since 'view' is a action by default anonymous can see we need
#    to make sure 'view' isnt the only action they can do on the object
#    Also we check to see if PUBLISHED method (we have access to because
#    it did publish) is in the actions somewhere.
#
#    Alot of this could be refactored if Actions could do filter for you
#    but I cant suggest right now.  Something like 'I want to query'
#    only actions that are declared for a type in the types tool. It would
#    be convient to be able to get actions from the ActionProviders as well
#    as the portal_actions (aggregate of all ActionProviders)
#
#    This hack can go away if we implement something like CMFViews.
#    We should extend FSMetadata.py for a [plone] section that each
#    template could define explicitly if they want to show their border.
#    But its too late in the game for such a large change.
#    border=None or False or border=True, no border attribute should
#    calculate using the arcane rules below *wink*
